# Six degrees of separation - IMDB
This project implements a graph traversal algorithm to explore the concept of "Six Degrees of Separation" within the context of the IMDb database. The application finds the shortest connection between actors through their shared movies, and calculates the total number of connected components using both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.

To run the application run the Innleveringsoppgave3 class "java Innleveringsoppgave3"
